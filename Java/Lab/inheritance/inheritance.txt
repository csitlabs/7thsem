## Problem Statement:
You are developing a vehicle management system. the system should support different types of vehicles likes cars and bikes while following OOP principles.

### Task:
1. Abstraction: Create an abstract class Vehicle with the following:
   - String brand (Encapsulated use getter & setter)
   - An abstract method void startEngine();

2. Inheritance:
   - Create two classes, Car and Bike that inherit from vehicle.
Implement the startEngine() method in both subclasses.
